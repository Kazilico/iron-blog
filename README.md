This was the second assignment at the Iron Yard, again focusing on HTML and CSS. [Here] (https://github.com/TIY-DC-FEE-Jan-2015/assignments/tree/gh-pages/03-html-blog-layout) is the original repository for the assignment. We had to recreate a [tumblr blogpost] (http://dc.theironyard.com/post/103666168283/here-we-go).

It's worth noting that tumblr's dashboard has changed since this assignment, with the follow button moving from a fixed position window in the lower right corner to a transitioning transparant menu in the upper right corner.
