					<div class="p2">Hello, My name is Su Kim, and I am the Campus Director at our new<a href="http://theironyard.com/dc"> DC/Arlington campus </a>I am coming to The Iron Yard after years of policy advocacy in human rights and immigration reform. My passions are people and removing barriers that stand in the way of people being the best they are. I am excited to see how we at The Iron Yard can showcase the best of technology through passionate, driven, creative, and well-equipped individuals that go on to tackle the problems of the world or to realize an amazing idea.

					<div class="p3"> A little introduction to our space & neighbors:</div>
					<div class="p4">
					The Iron Yard is so thrilled to be among brilliant and creative minds on the 10th floor of 2231 Crystal Drive. The space where The Iron Yard will occupy is still being built out, so I have being hanging out on the other side. Here is a bit of the awesomeness of every day at <a href="http://www.disruption.vc">Disruption Corporation</a> HQ.
